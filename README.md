DGL Homepage
============

This homepage is generated by [jekyll](jekyll). However, because some plugins are not
supported by Github, we put all the jekyll related codes in the jekyll folder and put
the generated sites (all the stuffs in `_site` folder from jekyll) in the root folder.

* Ruby
* [bundler](https://bundler.io/)

Setup
-----
In `jekyll` folder:
* `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`

Build
