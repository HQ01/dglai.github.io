DGL Homepage
============

This homepage is generated by [jekyll](jekyll). However, because some plugins are not
supported by Github, we put all the jekyll related codes in the jekyll folder and put
the generated sites (all the stuffs in `_site` folder from jekyll) in the root folder.

Requirements
------------
* Ruby
* [bundler](https://bundler.io/)

Setup
-----
In `jekyll` folder:
* `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`

Build
-----
In `jekyll` folder:
* `bundle exec jekyll build`

Scripts
-----------
In the root folder:
* Clean the generated static sites: `bash script/clean.sh`
* Copy the jekyll generated sites to root folder: `bash script/ship.sh`
* Clean, ship and serve locally: `bash script/clean_and_serve.sh`

How to upload your change
-------------------------
The `master` branch has been protected to avoid accidentally breaking our website.
Use PR to merge your changes instead. A common process:
* Create a branch and change some stuffs.
* Build the site.
* Clean, ship and serve locally to see whether the change is OK.
  - Be aware that some links might be broken. For example, all the {{site.url}} will point to
    `dgl.ai` so be careful not to jump to the currently hosting site.
* Push the branch, PR and merge.

What's in jekyll folder?
------------------------
Checkout [jekyll](jekyll)'s tutorial before you proceed. Here, we list several usages (first cd into
`jekyll` folder):

* To change the `About` page, look at `about.md` for the text. For the `Our History` section,
  See `_includes/our_history.html`.
* To add change log in the `Updates` page, see `page/updates.html`.
* To add new blog, put your markdown file under `_post` folder. Follow the name convention as
  the other blogs in the folder. This is important for the blog page to render the correct date.
  You may read other stashed examples under `_bak` folder.
